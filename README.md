# GitHub Copilot Code Review System

An intelligent, automated code review system that uses GitHub Actions to review pull requests and intelligently respond to developer feedback.

## 🌟 Features

### Automated Code Review
- **Security Analysis**: Detects hardcoded credentials, SQL injection vulnerabilities, and other security issues
- **Code Quality Checks**: Identifies empty catch blocks, improper logging, and code smells
- **Best Practices**: Suggests improvements for coding standards and maintainability
- **Language Support**: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more

### Intelligent Response Handling
The system can understand and respond to three types of developer comments:

1. **Questions** - Provides helpful answers and guidance
   - Example: "Why is this needed?" → Bot explains the reasoning

2. **Defenses** - Evaluates technical justifications
   - Valid defense → Automatically resolves the comment ✅
   - Invalid defense → Provides counter-arguments

3. **Acknowledgments** - Confirms receipt of feedback
   - Example: "Thanks, will fix!" → Bot acknowledges positively

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Separation of Concerns
The system follows a clean architecture with clear separation between orchestration and business logic:

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   └── copilot-review.yml          # Workflow orchestration (minimal logic)
└── scripts/
    ├── perform-review.js            # Review orchestration
    ├── review-analyzer.js           # Code analysis logic
    ├── comment-poster.js            # GitHub API interactions
    ├── handle-response.js           # Response orchestration
    ├── response-analyzer.js         # Response analysis logic
    ├── test-functionality.js        # Functionality tests
    ├── README.md                    # Technical documentation
    └── EXAMPLES.md                  # Usage examples
```

### Why This Design?

✅ **Maintainability** - Each module has a single, clear responsibility  
✅ **Testability** - Components can be tested in isolation  
✅ **Reusability** - Logic can be reused across workflows  
✅ **Readability** - Workflow YAML stays clean and declarative  
✅ **Extensibility** - Easy to add new features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Node.js 20+ (for local testing)

### Setup

1. **The workflow is already configured** in `.github/workflows/copilot-review.yml`

2. **How it works:**
   - When a PR is opened or updated → Automatic code review
   - When someone comments on a review → Intelligent response

3. **No additional configuration needed!** The workflow uses the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### Testing

```bash
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd .github/scripts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run functionality tests
node test-functionality.js
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Security Issue

**PR Change:**
```java
private String password = "admin123";
```

**Bot Review:**
> 🔒 **Security Issue**: Possible hardcoded credentials detected. Please use environment variables or a secure vault for sensitive data.

**Developer Response:**
> Why is this a problem? It's just for testing.

**Bot Reply:**
> Good question! The main concern here is: Hardcoded credentials can be accidentally committed to version control and exposed. Even for testing, credentials should be stored in environment variables...

### Example 2: Valid Defense

**Developer Response:**
> This is necessary for backward compatibility with the legacy API. Documentation: https://docs.example.com/legacy

**Bot Reply:**
> ✅ Thank you for the explanation! Your reasoning is valid:
> • This is necessary for backward compatibility with the legacy API
> 
> This addresses the concern raised in the review. Marking this as resolved.

See [EXAMPLES.md](.github/scripts/EXAMPLES.md) for more detailed examples.

## 🔍 What Gets Reviewed

### Security Issues (High Priority)
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure cryptographic practices

### Code Quality Issues
- Empty catch blocks
- Improper error handling
- Missing logging

### Best Practices
- Console.log in production code
- System.out.println instead of proper logging
- Use of `var` instead of `let`/`const`
- Loose equality (`==`) instead of strict (`===`)

### Code Style
- Very long lines (>120 characters)
- High complexity/nesting
- TODO comments without tracking

## 🎯 Comment Resolution

Comments are **automatically resolved** when the developer provides:

1. **Valid technical justification** such as:
   - Performance/optimization reasons
   - Backward compatibility requirements
   - Framework/library conventions
   - Design pattern justification
   - Test/mock data explanation

2. **Sufficient detail** including:
   - Code examples or references
   - Detailed explanation (>20 words)
   - Links to documentation

3. **Validity score ≥ 0.7** (calculated from reasoning quality)

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Review Rules

Edit `.github/scripts/review-analyzer.js`:

```javascript
// In checkForIssues() function
if (yourCondition) {
  issues.push({
    severity: 'medium',
    message: '📝 Your custom check message',
  });
}
```

### Adding New Response Types

Edit `.github/scripts/response-analyzer.js`:

```javascript
// In analyzeResponse() function
const customIndicators = ['keyword1', 'keyword2'];
if (customIndicators.some(indicator => lowerBody.includes(indicator))) {
  type = 'custom_type';
}
```

### Adjusting Resolution Criteria

Edit `.github/scripts/response-analyzer.js` in the `shouldResolveComment()` function to modify when comments are auto-resolved.

## 📚 Documentation

- [Technical Documentation](.github/scripts/README.md) - Detailed architecture and implementation
- [Usage Examples](.github/scripts/EXAMPLES.md) - Real-world scenarios and responses
- [Workflow Configuration](.github/workflows/copilot-review.yml) - GitHub Actions setup

## 🧪 Testing the System

1. **Create a test PR** with intentional issues:
   ```java
   // Add this to any Java file
   private String password = "test123";
   System.out.println("Debug info");
   ```

2. **Wait for the review** - The bot will comment on the issues

3. **Respond to the comments:**
   - Ask a question: "Why is this needed?"
   - Defend the change: "This is required because..."
   - Acknowledge: "Thanks, will fix!"

4. **Observe the bot's responses** - See how it handles each type

## 🔒 Security

- Uses GitHub's automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no manual token configuration needed)
- Only responds to non-bot users (prevents infinite loops)
- Follows security best practices in its own code

## 🤝 Contributing

To contribute to this review system:

1. Modify the scripts in `.github/scripts/`
2. Test locally with `node test-functionality.js`
3. Submit a PR (which will be reviewed by this system! 😄)

**Q: Can I disable it for specific PRs?**  
A: Yes, add `[skip ci]` to your PR title or commit message.

**Q: Does it work with private repositories?**  
A: Yes, it uses the automatic GITHUB_TOKEN which works in private repos.

**Q: Can I customize the review rules?**  
A: Absolutely! Edit the scripts in `.github/scripts/` to add or modify rules.
